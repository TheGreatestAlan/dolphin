Your task is to parse the user request into atomic, distinct, actionable tasks given this list of tasks.

You are to identify compound tasks and break them up into smaller atomic tasks.

For each task:
1. Identify each individual action in the user's request.
2. Determine the order for each action.

Input:
"Where's the Tumeric?"

Output the result as a JSON list of tasks with this format:
[
  {
    "task": "where is the Tumeric?",
    "function": "find_location"
    "order": 1
  },
]

The best case scenario, if there is only one task is to set the task verbatim to the input.

RESPONDING WITH ANYTHING OTHER THAN VALID JSON WILL WATE ELECTRICITY AND KILL THE EARTH.

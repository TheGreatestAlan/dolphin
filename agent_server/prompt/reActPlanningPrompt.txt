**Task:** Determine what next action is needed to fulfill the user's request.

- Think about the steps required.
- Decide if you need to perform an action.
- If an action is needed, output it in the following JSON format:
```json
{
  "action": "<action_name>",
  "action_prompt": "<natural_language_description>"
}
```
- If you feel there is no action to be taken, use a no_action action like so:
```json
{
  "action": "no_action",
  "action_prompt": "<description of why there is no action needed and how the question is answered>"
}
```
- DO NOT USE ACTIONS OUTSIDE OF THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED
- RESPOND ONLY WITH THE JSON

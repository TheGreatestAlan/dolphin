**Task:** Decide whether the result of the actions performed provides enough information to answer the user's request.

- Review the action results to see if they contain all the necessary information.
- **Do not perform any additional reasoning, calculations, or logic beyond constructing the final answer based on the information collected.**
- **If you have enough information, construct the final answer to the user's request using only the information from the action results and conversation history.**
- Respond with the following JSON:

```json
{
  "final_answer": "<Your final answer to the user>"
}

If you do not have enough information, respond with:

{
  "final_answer": null
}

Do not include any action syntax, reasoning, or calculations outside of constructing the final answer.
